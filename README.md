Description:
College Library (CL) is currently cooperating as a client for our group. Pamela and Kelli, staff at CL, will be our main clients. They requested us to develop a new button-making system to replace their current implementation. Some features that they are looking for is accepting button-maker reservations, approving exceptions, adding reservations, and notifying patrons about reservation confirmations. The theme for this project development is stream-lining. Current reservations (Google Calendar) are handled manually via Kelli/Pamela.

User Stories 

Story 1: As a user, I want a clear header so I can navigate easily.

Story 2: As CL staff/administrator, I want a clean and understandable homepage that is easy to use so users don’t get lost and leave the site. 

Story 3: As an administrator, I want to see and I want users to see what days are open to reserve a button maker.

Sprint Review (4 points)
1.	What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
a.	We learned that there is a lot of planning involved. There is a lot of things that came up that we weren’t able to think of at the time we were planning which resulted in some improvised planning. We also learned that communication is truly key when it comes to these projects. 
2.	What did go well? Why?
a.	Our cohort was very collaborative. Each member was very involved and creative with ideas. This flexibility and speed allowed us to expedite the sprint with minimal issues.
3.	What didn’t go well? Why not?
a.	For much of the beginning of the project we were all confused and not on the same page. We had some trouble getting the project started, understanding where to start and what to do at some of our meetings slowed us down for some time. 
4.	How can you make things better next time?
a.	One thing we can do to make things better next time would be to have more firmly set tasks before we begin. At the start of our sprint, we had a few tasks but we added onto them in the middle of it, causing the burndown to be thrown off a bit. Another aspect that will be improved is our communication between each other. It was already at a high level and we did a good job communicating our schedules and thoughts, but as we become more familiar with each other and move along the project we can get our work done more smoothly.
5.	Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
a.	Yes, we are satisfied with what we have already completed because we went above and beyond the work for the sprint and started working on the functionality of the pages. We are very happy with our prototypes and decided to move on to the next step, which was actually making the website. We also scheduled a standing meeting on Fridays at the same time so we can ensure that we will have ample time to complete the assignment.
6.	Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
