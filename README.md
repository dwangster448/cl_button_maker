Evidence of Work Completed:
Sprint Review:
From the first sprint, we learned that it is better to spread out the work rather than do the majority of the work all on the same day. Therefore, we met a few more times than the first sprint, and we still had our heavy work day on Friday, but it felt more manageable. Staying in more constant communications made the sprint feel easier.
I think we were very successful in our communications and ensuring that everyone dedicates time to this project. Everyone was flexible with timing to meet and willing to work around others schedules. I also think we were good at communicating when we had issues and asking for help.
We had some issues with the git side of the project with pushing and pulling, we made some incorrect commits and accidentally pushed to the wrong branches, so we had to sort that out, but I think we now have a better understanding of how to do this correctly.
Next time, before making a commit, we can check to make sure we are on the right branch and there will not be any merge conflicts. We can also be more communicative about when to push and pull so all group members understand the process and can have the most updated versions of our project. This will keep us up to date on the project and the tasks that need to be completed. I also think we did a good job with communications and can continue this into the next sprint. 
Yes, we are very satisfied with what we have already completed because we met all of the tasks that we set out to complete and our webpage looks clean and matches all of the fonts correctly like we intended. Although we are still working on some of the functionality and code to complete the site entirely, what we have completed so far is what we meant to have accomplished by the end of this sprint.

SPRINT 1 INFO
Description:
College Library (CL) is currently cooperating as a client for our group. Pamela and Kelli, staff at CL, will be our main clients. They requested us to develop a new button-making system to replace their current implementation. Some features that they are looking for is accepting button-maker reservations, approving exceptions, adding reservations, and notifying patrons about reservation confirmations. The theme for this project development is stream-lining. Current reservations (Google Calendar) are handled manually via Kelli/Pamela.

Sprint Review (4 points)
1.	What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
a.	We learned that there is a lot of planning involved. There is a lot of things that came up that we weren’t able to think of at the time we were planning which resulted in some improvised planning. We also learned that communication is truly key when it comes to these projects. 
2.	What did go well? Why?
a.	Our cohort was very collaborative. Each member was very involved and creative with ideas. This flexibility and speed allowed us to expedite the sprint with minimal issues.
3.	What didn’t go well? Why not?
a.	For much of the beginning of the project we were all confused and not on the same page. We had some trouble getting the project started, understanding where to start and what to do at some of our meetings slowed us down for some time. 
4.	How can you make things better next time?
a.	One thing we can do to make things better next time would be to have more firmly set tasks before we begin. At the start of our sprint, we had a few tasks but we added onto them in the middle of it, causing the burndown to be thrown off a bit. Another aspect that will be improved is our communication between each other. It was already at a high level and we did a good job communicating our schedules and thoughts, but as we become more familiar with each other and move along the project we can get our work done more smoothly.
5.	Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
a.	Yes, we are satisfied with what we have already completed because we went above and beyond the work for the sprint and started working on the functionality of the pages. We are very happy with our prototypes and decided to move on to the next step, which was actually making the website. We also scheduled a standing meeting on Fridays at the same time so we can ensure that we will have ample time to complete the assignment.
6.	Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
